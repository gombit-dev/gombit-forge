// Mint allocates a frozen source symbol for an entity in a namespace, resolving
// collisions at mint time (ADR-001 §5, §8–9). It:
//
//  1. normalizes the label to a candidate identifier — or, for a label with no
//     usable content, falls back to a symbol derived from the entity's kind;
//  2. selects the first candidate that is neither already recorded in the
//     namespace (live or tombstoned — §10, a tombstoned symbol is never reused)
//     nor reserved, appending a numeric suffix as needed: Email, Email2,
//     Email3, …;
//  3. records that symbol against entityID in the ledger and returns it.
//
// The symbol is frozen before Mint returns, so a collision never enters an
// accepted ProjectSpec and no state is created that would need a breaking
// refactor merely to compile (§9). Minting is once per entity: if the entity
// already owns a live symbol in the namespace, Mint returns it unchanged — so a
// retry (a double-submit, or a transaction replayed after a later failure)
// converges rather than allocating a second symbol, and a relabel does not
// re-mint (the code symbol is a frozen ABI, D1).
//
// reserved reports whether a candidate collides with a generated or framework
// symbol in this namespace (e.g. IsReservedCodeName for a resource's field
// namespace). It may be nil when the namespace reserves nothing. Mint bounds its
// search (maxMintAttempts) and fails closed rather than looping forever if a
// namespace's reserved set or ledger swallows a whole run of a base's suffixes.
