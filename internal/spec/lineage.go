// Identity continuity (ADR-001 §57-62, D14).
//
// Forge-managed mutations preserve stable-ID lineage by construction, so
// migration and rename inference can trust them. A local-first spec, though, can
// be hand-edited, script-changed, Git-merged or restored from odd history, so
// the on-disk spec cannot be assumed to descend safely from the last accepted
// revision (§57). CheckLineage is the semantic lineage validation reopening runs
// (§61): it compares the trusted prior spec with the current one and reports
// whether identity is continuous.
//
// The scope is schema identity — resources and their fields — because that is
// what migration and destructive rename/drop inference depend on (§57, §62).
// Pages, navigation and hooks carry stable IDs too, but rewriting one has no
// migration consequence, so they are deliberately out of this check.

// IdentityRef is one schema entity's stable identity plus enough presentation to
// describe it in a resolution prompt (§59): the storage_name is what a
// discontinuity is usually seen through (email → contact_email).

// Lineage is the identity-continuity analysis between a trusted prior spec (the

//
// It reports only what changed by stable ID: entities Removed since the prior
// spec and entities Added. It never reports a rename. A Forge rename keeps the
// same stable ID and changes only label/storage, so it appears in neither list —
// which is the structural guarantee that a rename can never be *inferred* across
// an ID change (§58, §94): the analysis has no field a consumer could read as
// "fld_A became fld_B".

// rewrite (fld_A → fld_B) is indistinguishable from a delete-plus-add. When this
// is true, Forge must refuse automatic rename or destructive inference and ask
// for explicit resolution (DiscontinuityResolutions).
//
// A pure addition (nothing removed) or a pure deletion (nothing added) is not a
// discontinuity: there is no ambiguous rename target, so ID-based diffing handles
// it without guessing. Only the coexistence of a removal and an addition is the
