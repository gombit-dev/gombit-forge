// ExtensionsRoot is the user-owned code directory (ADR-001 §17). Forge may
// compile it, observe whether files exist, and archive it with explicit consent,
// but it never rewrites the implementation. Nothing in this package writes here.
const ExtensionsRoot = "internal/extensions"

// generatedRoots are the directories Forge wholly owns (ADR-001 §16): it wipes
// and recreates them on every materialization and writes nothing outside them.
// Everything Compile emits must live under one of these. It is unexported —
// exported it would be a package-level slice governing recursive deletion in a
// user's project that any importer could repoint. Read it through GeneratedRoots.
var generatedRoots = []string{gen.GeneratedRoot, gen.FrontendRoot}

// GeneratedRoots returns the directories Forge wholly owns and recreates on
// every materialization. It returns a copy so a caller cannot widen the set that
// Materialize wipes.
func GeneratedRoots() []string { return slices.Clone(generatedRoots) }

// Materialize writes the compiled files into the project rooted at dir.
//
// It recreates the generated roots rather than merging into them, so a resource
// the spec deleted, renamed or split leaves no stale generated file behind
// (ADR-001 §16). Ownership is at the directory level (§18): Materialize touches
// only the generated roots, never internal/extensions/** (§17) or anything else.
//
// It is careful about the destructive half, not just the writes:
//
//   - It refuses an empty file set. A compile that produced no files is a caller
//     error (a mishandled Compile error hands over a nil slice), never a reason
//     to delete a project's generated code — so it fails closed (D14) rather
//     than wiping and reporting success.
//   - It validates every path is a clean relative path under a generated root
//     before touching disk, so a generator bug or crafted path cannot write into
//     user territory (§18).
//   - It stages then swaps with renames only. Each root's new contents are
//     written into a sibling staging directory (pass 1); then, per root, the
//     live tree is moved aside with a rename and the staging directory renamed
//     into its place (pass 2). Both are renames, which never recurse, so an
//     interrupted materialization leaves each generated root either fully
//     updated or untouched — never a half-written tree (unlike a recursive
//     delete, which can tear a root then fail). The swap is per root: with more
//     than one root a failure between swaps can leave one root updated and
//     another not, which re-running converges. A process killed in the brief
//     window between the two renames leaves the root absent, its previous
//     contents in the retired sibling and the new ones in the staging sibling;
//     re-running materialization, or renaming the retired sibling back,
//     recovers it. Both siblings are named with a leading dot so the Go
//     toolchain ignores them rather than compiling a stray copy of the tree
//     (see hiddenSibling).
