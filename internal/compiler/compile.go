// Package compiler is the ProjectSpec-to-source pipeline (DESIGN.md §9). It
// composes the domain graph with the code generators and returns the complete
// compiler-owned file tree.
//
// The pipeline is deterministic by construction: the same compiler version and
// the same spec produce a byte-identical tree (DESIGN.md §32, ADR-001 §83).
// Stages run in a fixed order, each generator preserves the graph's authored
// order and never ranges a map into ordered output, and every generated Go
// file is run through gofmt as it is produced — so the formatter is an
// integral pipeline step, not an afterthought.
