// HTTP-layer test: pins "every project operation is behind the cookie gate" and
// runs in CI. It uses a sentinel gate that rejects before any handler, so it
// needs no database and is not skipped under -short. Delete Middlewares from any
// route in RegisterRoutes and one operation reaches the (nil) handler instead of
// the gate, failing here.
