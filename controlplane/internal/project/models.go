// Package project is the control plane's project and revision store (DESIGN.md
// §8). A Project belongs to an organization and accumulates an append-only
// chain of immutable ProjectRevisions; each revision pins the exact canonical
// ProjectSpec and its hash, and points at the revision it descended from. That
// chain is what makes deterministic rebuilds, rollback, diff and semantic
// lineage possible (DESIGN.md §8, ADR-001 §60).
//
// The canonical encoding and hash come from the compiler's internal/spec — the
// single source of truth for how a spec serializes (ADR-001 §70) — so a
// revision's stored bytes and the compiler's are the same bytes.
